# Retrospective Analysis
Overall, I think I haven’t gotten as far as I’d have liked on this project. Initially it was because I was running out of time, but more recently it’s been a case of constantly running into more problems to get the workflow I’d like. When I started this project, I was hoping to be able to get away with having to write very little HTML code, but as I get deeper into this project, I’m finding out that, in order to get what I would like out of the site, I have to write a lot more tools and HTML converters than I’d have liked. Additionally, I’ve been struggling to find a way to solve my original goal of using the Obsidian markdown editor, since the markdown flavor used by Obsidian is drastically different from the one that is available for GitHub pages. Admittedly, if I have to write my own parser anyway, it shouldn’t be too hard to add Obsidian’s markdown features, but I do worry that would cause a lot more work to get added to the project. 
Admittedly, I believe that some of this research could have been done and figured out way earlier if I had spent more time on the project, especially outside of class, but unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time early on in the semester due to some overlaying responsibilities from summer. While I would’ve liked to be much further along on this, I think I oversimplified certain elements, and underestimated how long external responsibilities would take me, which is what has caused this project to make very slow progress.

# Changes
I think that, because the formatting and design aspects of the website are taking much longer than planned, I should pivot the second half of this semester to focus much more heavily on that, and instead of creating 3 videos, just 1 video, or a blog post if there’s not enough time for a video. The most important thing I would like to get out of this class, in my opinion, is a website hosted on GitHub Pages that lets me easily make updates in markdown, preferably through Obsidian, that translates to professional and clean-looking webpages. 
While the base technology for the website is important, I do think I will want to call a hard cut in the last week to ensure I have an example for what the demonstration of my work would look like on the website. Therefore, if, by the end of Week 12, I don’t have the website fully where I’d like it to be, I may write a blog post in pure HTML, so I at least have a frame of reference for how to show off my skills.
