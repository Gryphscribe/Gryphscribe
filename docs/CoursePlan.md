# Overview
Improve Website?  
	Want to have one, working on it feels like a Task rather than something fun  
Learn how to sell my work to others without having to physically explain it  
Make the barrier to entry to writing blogs/creating videos lower  
Brainstorm about how to work on this while remaining excited about the work itself  

True Goal: More confident in my resources to send to jobs but also how to find jobs in my realm of interest?  
# Job Research
Overall, I researched a majority of Tools Related Programmer positions, alongside a couple of Technical Design positions and a few Gameplay Programmer positions. Although most of the Programmer and Engineer jobs requested strong C++ and C# skills, there were a few that asked for Python skills, and not all of them required any specific language. Conversely, Riot Games' Technical Game Designer position specifically called out familiarity and comfortability with C++. One interesting note is that of the three Gameplay Programmer positions I researched, the one at Supergiant (from October 2022) was more similar to the Tools Programmer positions at other companies than the Gameplay Programmer ones. It included requests about code design patterns and iteration, while the Gameplay Programmer positions posted at Epic and Riot had more focus on the initial creation of features in their postings. The technical design positions I researched had similar non-programming skill requests, although EA's posting didn't have any required languages, other than stating that knowledge in a scripting language would be helpful.  
While some of the job postings I found were for specific systems, such as Epic Games' Senior Tools Programmer position that appeared to be focused on Unreal's Motion Design features, most of them had general and somewhat vague descriptions of the work someone in that position would do. Generally, I saw many descriptions of improving existing features, frameworks, and tools and the occasional request to design and implement new tools. The Tools Programmer positions had more of a focus on automation, build tools, and unit tests however, including Bethesda's Build Programmer, which upon reading was very similar to parts of other Tools Programmer positions. Almost every job posting also had the requirement to work with other teams, but I most frequently saw UI/UX and QA teams across all postings.

# Personal Assessment
## Professional Identity
The most descriptive title I might give myself would be a "Tools Engineer with a specialty in Technical Design", describing the core areas of work I would like to do. I have the most interest in the process of designing elegant and efficient tools that make it possible for me or my team to more efficiently create new content. I have a deep inclination to automate as much as I can, so that as soon as a piece of data is updated, the functionality of the game is updated accordingly.   
### Hard Skills
I would classify the following as my strongest hard skills
- Strong C/C++ Knowledge and Prowess
- 4+ years of Unity Experience
- Experience working with ImGui
- Visual Studio, VSCode, and Rider
- GitHub, SVN, and Perforce
- Local Telemetry Output
- Data-Driven Architecture
	- Especially Data-Driven Input Systems
- Automation
- Markdown

The hard skills below I have experience in, and while I'm not as confident in them, I would be happy working on projects where my work involves using them
- Distributed Systems
- Computer Networking
- Procedural Content Generation
- Data Visualization
- Custom Engines

And these are Hard Skills I don't believe I have, but saw come up in a few of the job descriptions
- Unreal Experience
- Profiling & Optimization of Code
- Python
- Database Programming

### Soft Skills
I would classify the following as my strongest soft skills
- Developing team resources for efficiency
	- What I call "Tools Engineering for People"
- Creative Problem-Solving
- Breaking apart a problem into easily digestible pieces
	- And in such a way that each part can seamlessly interact with one another
- Documentation
- Personal Time & Task Management (Have a Trello Board for homework)

The following soft skills I would say I have to a degree, but would rather not have to use them at this point in time
- People Management
- Teaching

## How to Convey Professional Identity
I would say that, across the board, I'm fairly bad at conveying who I am and what I can do, outside of personal interviews and skills tests. I have a habit of down playing what I can do, which makes it hard to create any content or artifacts that demonstrate it. As such, my Resume, Website, and LinkedIn are all pretty barren or outdated, as the task of figuring out how to sell myself is often overwhelming.  
Ideally, my Resume and LinkedIn have very similar content, with LinkedIn being a more general point of contact, while the Resume shifts based on what job I am applying for. Additionally, these two should both pull from my website, which has all of the content that would be on my resume, but in an expanded form. This would include blog articles, demo videos, and a detailed timeline of academic, professional, and personal projects.  
## Course Focus Areas
I think for this course, I would like to focus on developing systems to make it easier for me to update a website with Videos, Blog Posts, and other Achievements, that can then be populated into LinkedIn and a resume. Especially, I'd like to port my current website over to a markdown format hosted by GitHub, as that is considerably cheaper (free bar any domain stuff I wanna do), and I'm much more confident in my markdown skills than I am HTML or something similar, and fighting with a website-creation platform to get it to do exactly I want leads to frustration which will likely end up deterring me from updating the site. As part of this I would also like to create some demo videos based off of previous projects I have made, which would be my secondary goal for the project.  
As a stretch goal, if the website is at a place where I am happy, and I have enough videos for the website, then I would like to spend a week or so updating my LinkedIn to incorporate the content I have put on my website.
